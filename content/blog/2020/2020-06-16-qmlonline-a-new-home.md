# What is next

Now that the project is under KDE organization, I'll start with the planned new capabilities, such as the Kirigami support and the html element to help with online documentation of qml snippets.

And to finish this quick update, be invited to help with the project and send [Merge Requests](https://invent.kde.org/webapps/qmlonline/-/merge_requests), [feature requests and opinions](https://invent.kde.org/webapps/qmlonline/-/issues/new).
