A ~~long~~ time ago I saw [this in hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2018/02/21/linux-adds-ch341-gpio/), after investigation over it on internet, I decided to get one from [aliexpress](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/ALL-IN-1-CH341A-USB-to-SPI-I2C-IIC-UART-TTL-ISP-Serial-Adapter-Module-EPP/32878482645.html) ($9).

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Back</figcaption>

This dongle should provide:
 - SPI/ISP [Front (4)]
 - I²C [Front (6)]
 - UART-TTL [Front (3, 7, 8)]
 - GPIO [Front (3, 4), Back (1)]

The main CI is the CH341A.

In [Back (2)] we have a 3.3V regulator.

The switch in [Front (1)] will change the USB PID value.
 - For I²C and SPI: `idVendor=1a86, idProduct=5512, bcdDevice= 3.04`
 - For UART: `idVendor=1a86, idProduct=5523, bcdDevice= 3.04`
Making the USB driver to select the correct kernel module to deal with it.

It's also possible to change the output voltage with the voltage selection switches [Front (2, 5)].

I'm pretty happy with the hardware, the selection keys makes everything easy to configure and dealing between all the modes sounds pretty possible. It would be better to have all modes at the same time, but that is not possible and does not sound as a terrible thing right now for me. Besides that, the 3.3V regulator can provide up to 1A, and that sounds pretty good also.

The serial interface mode works without any problem as a normal ch341a serial interface (some Arduinos does use it).

The big question is the other modes, like I²C, GPIO and SPI. But the great and beautiful community has already the modules for all functionalities.

## How to compile, load and remove a module

First things first:
 - To load something that you compiled
    - Compile with `make`
    - Load with `sudo insmod module_name.ko`
    - Unload with `sudo rmmod module_name`
 - To load a kernel module
    - Load with `sudo modprobe module`
    - Unload with `sudo rmmod module`

That's what you need to know, for anything else you can use Google.

## GPIO and I²C

All GPIOs are provided with `sysfs`, I would personally prefer something like [libiio](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-software/libiio) or providing `/dev/*` devices (Like in: [I²C](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/i2c/dev-interface) or [SPI](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/spi/spidev)).


(The GPIO in both SPI and I²C are D* Pins in [Back (1)] and CS* in [Front (4)]).

Ok, to check the I²C, you need to make sure that your **i2c-dev** module is loaded, you can search it in `/lib/modules ` with `find . | grep i2c-dev ` and load it with `sudo modprobe i2c-dev`, this will allow the modules to show the I²C devices under `/dev`.

The **gschorcht/i2c-ch341-usb** driver will returns in `dmesg`:
```

Showing our 8 pins plus the `i2c-8` device running at 100khz.

I was able to do a simple test with `i2cdetect 8`. (You can get it from i2c-tools).

You can download my i2cdetect test [raw .logicdata](/assets/ch341a_dongle/i2cdetect.logicdata) or a [csv](/assets/ch341a_dongle/i2cdetect.csv).


I did a simple test with `while true; do echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio0/value; echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio0/value; done`, and the example `gpio_output.c` file, both were able to toggle the GPIO at average 10khz.

## SPI

For the spi device, you need also to load the device module called **spidev**, `sudo modprove spidev`. Now with the driver loaded, you should just compile and load the spi module.

```

[315824.392423] spi-ch341-usb 1-1.1.1:1.0: ch341_usb_probe: connected
```

The SPI was running with 1.5MHz, the tests was done with python-spidev.
```python
import spidev
spi = spidev.SpiDev()
spi.open(0, 0)
to_send = []
for i in range(30):
	to_send += [i]
spi.xfer(to_send)
```

More than 30 bytes will give:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 7, in <module>
    spi.xfer(to_send)
TimeoutError: [Errno 110] Connection timed out
```

I'm not sure why.

## Final

Yes, I give a positive vote in this device, everything appears to be working with the correct kernel modules.
I don't have time right now to test with real devices/sensors, but everything shows that will work, I'll **try** to update this subject in the future.
